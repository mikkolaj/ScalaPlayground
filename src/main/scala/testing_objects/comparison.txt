Goal of this package is to compare different ways of providing dependencies.
Using objects has proven to be problematic when it comes to unit testing.
Out of two libraries (ScalaMock and MockitoScala) supporting a way to mock scala objects
none of them has worked in my environment. Depending on the complexity of a module
using OOP style or Scala Cake Pattern might be the way to go.
